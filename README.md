# RETIRED Breeze.js bower and npm packages

The former "breeze.js" bower and npm packages have been retired as of January 20, 2014. They are **frozen at breeze release v.1.5.2**. This repo will be retained indefinitely.

We've separated the breeze core and breeze labs content into their own packages:
* **breeze-client**
* **breeze-client-labs**

You'll get almost the same effect with

    bower install breeze-client
    bower install breeze-client-labs

You'll have to adjust your script tags too because the files have moved around a bit too ... in obvious ways.

See those packages for details.
